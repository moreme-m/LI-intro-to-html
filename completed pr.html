    <h1>SUGAR GLIDERS</h1>
    <h3>
        Sugar gliders are squirrel-sized arboreal marsupials that inhabit the forests of Australia and New Guinea.
        Sugar gliders have opposable thumbs and four fingers on both hands and feet. 
        Each finger has a sharp toe that can hook like Velcro to most non-slick surfaces.
